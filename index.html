	<h1>History of Tattoo Machines</h1>
<br>
	<p>Thomas Edison invented the electric pen in Newark, New Jersey, in 1876 with the intention of being a duplicating device. In 1891, Samuel O'Reilly modified it by adding a tube and needle system with an ink reservoir that could introduce ink into the skin. This was the original Rotary Tattoo Machine.</p>
